Bits and pieces for MythTV

1 - MythUserRename.py : This script can be installed as a USER JOB to run immediately on completion of a recording job.  It creates a user readable name comprised of the %TITLE%-%SUBTITLE% as a symlink to the recording in a separate folder which can then be used as the source for other clients (e.g. Jellyfin, Kodi, VLC... anything that supports DLNA).
